# Number Classification using Neural Networks (Mar-Apr 2019)  
Group project in CSE 474 Machine Learning to understand the basics of neural networks comparing a manually coded neural network in python to that of Google’s TensorFlow

# Results
-	Implemented forward/back propagation and regularization functions 
-	Identified Google’s TensorFlow is more efficient with large data sets
-	Used class API to create and train provide data
